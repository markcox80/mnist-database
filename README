The MNIST-DATABASE system provides an API for reading the label and
image data contained in the MNIST database available at
http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

The system consists of a single package MNIST-DATABASE. Documentation
on using the system can found by executing the following in the
read-eval-print loop.

(describe (find-package "MNIST-DATABASE"))

If you have not downloaded the MNIST database, the system
MNIST-DATABASE-DOWNLOAD contains a function
MNIST-DATABASE.DOWNLOAD:DOWNLOAD-MNIST-DATABASE that will download the
entire database (63M uncompressed) from the above website. The local
location of the database can be set by assigning a value to
MNIST-DATABASE:*PATH-TO-MNIST-DATABASE* or using the logical host
"MNIST-DATABASE".

Unit tests for the system can be executed with
(asdf:test-system "mnist-database")
